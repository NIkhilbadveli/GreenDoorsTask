- Started with two pages :- One with all the form inputs and the other with generated text
- Then modified it such that each input has it's own page
- Then added StyledComponents
- Then added a list to the right of the dropdown to show the available options persistently
- Made FormPage and Form components and hardcoded the individual page components in App.js along with the data
- Moved data into separate file.
